P2P communication library using deadlock-free routing.

Requirements:
0. Autotools to generate configure scripts and various *.in files.

1. GXP, parellel and distributed shell version 3.0 or above (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gxp/)
- This is because we rely on the GXP mw command to dispatch processes and do the initial handshaking (endpoint exchange) between all nodes.

2. XML Topology file that describes the topology, bandwidth, and latency between all nodes. This is an unfortunate disadvantage, and future work needs to take place to alleviate this restriction.

However, there is a sample xml file that is sufficient to run on the InTrigger environment (config/intrigger.xml) for the following clusters. This file also contains information sufficient to run on other University of Tokyo computing cluster environments (namely istbs and kototoi clusters)

- chiba
- okubo
- mirai
- keio
- hongo
- kototoi
- istbs
- suzuk
- kyoto
- imade
- hiro
- kyushu
- kobe

For more information on the InTrigger environment. Refer to www.intrigger.jp

Installation:
In the root directory, run the following command to generate the configure script
$ autoreconf -i --force

Refer to INSTALL.

Documentation:
Doxygen documentation can be generated if you run the following command in the root directory.
$ doxygen Doxyfile

Major user API files are documented for doxygen:
src/dlfree.c
src/gxp/gxp.c

Examples:
Examples are available under app/. Please refer to them for templates on how to use the library.

License:
Refer to LICENSE.
